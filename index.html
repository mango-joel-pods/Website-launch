<h1>Here is Joel Zellem's Website on the World Wide Web about nothing</h1>
<p> My website is all about nothing. This is created for a class and I am just following my professors instructions. I decided the purpose of this website is to tell time Hi Isaac</p>
<p> Well you have waited long enough, here is the time.</p>
<p></p> I just learned that I can not put the time on my website I am sorry for wasting yours. Here is a list about nothing! :)</p>
<ol>
<li>Now I am making a list</li>
<li>About nothing because</li>
<li>that is what this website is for</li>
<li>nothing</li>
<li>Nothing EXCEPT THIS!!!</li>
<LI>ARE YOU READY?!</LI>
<li>HERE IT COMES!</li>

<li>Epic Baby Bacon</li>
<p>Isn't that Epic Baby Bacon Epic?</p>
<p>Now that we are doing nonsense I have made a website before my computer nerd brother Isaac who is going to be the first one to get the link to this site. I wanna thank my mom and dad for being alive and also my grandparents for being alive yall are lit for that. If I can contribute my success to making this website is when my mom took my phone for like 6 monthes. That sucked. So now this website is dedicated to all the kids in the world who get their phone taken!</p>
